Hello there, I'm Rqtte, though may call me by name Roman. I'm new to coding and want to improve my skills, maybe even to a degree where they are marketable. 
I have some small scale Python experience and am currently looking in to Java. I would love to help out with an learn from any kind of projects involving 
these languages. If you want to reach out you can either send me an E-Mail (Roman_Koltsov@outlook.de) or message me on Discord(rqtte),
