Hello there, I'm Rqtte, though may call me by name Roman. I have coding experiences in Python and Java. I would love to help out with and learn from any kind of projects involving 
these languages. If you want to reach out you can either send me an E-Mail (Roman_Koltsov@outlook.de) or message me on Discord(rqtte). Have a good day :) !
